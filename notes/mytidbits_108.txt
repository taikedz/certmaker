Creating Self signed certificate with keyUsage extensions

You could try using openssl (available in most linux/unix environments) It supports the keyUsage extensions.

e.g. to create a self signed cert, you could use something similar to the following steps:

Locate and edit your openssl configuration /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf, make sure it contains the following lines uncommented:

	req_extensions = v3_req # The extensions to add to a certificate request
	keyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment

Add whatever key usage extensions you need if not already there.

Create private key

	openssl genrsa -des3 -out mytest.key 2048

remove pass phrase - optional

	openssl rsa -in mytest.key -out mytest.nopass.key

create cert signing request for your key

	openssl req -new -key mytest.nopass.key -out mytest.csr -config /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf

Confirm that your requested extensions are in the cert request

	openssl req -text -noout -in mytest.csr

Generate Self signed cert

	openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in mytest.csr -signkey mytest.nopass.key -out mytest.crt -extensions v3_req -extfile /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf

convert to p12 for browser

	openssl pkcs12 -export -in mytest.crt -inkey mytest.nopass.key -out mytest.p12

Import into browser and check the detailsâ€¦
