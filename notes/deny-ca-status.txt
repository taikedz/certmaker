One problem I have is that it seems any Cert geenrated seems to be able to sign other people's requests

There's some notes here

https://superuser.com/questions/462295/openssl-ca-and-non-ca-certificate

The other question is that some clients need the full trust chain to be returned by the server

How do we generate this full chain ?
